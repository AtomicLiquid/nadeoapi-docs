This is the Openplanet documentation for the Trackmania (2020) game APIs.

If you're not familiar with the authentication flow for any of the game APIs, check out [the Authentication guide](/auth).

The documentation is structured by the five main API domains, each of which cover a slightly different area of the game.

---

All game APIs are to be used responsibly. Nadeo/Ubisoft can and will ban your accounts/IPs if they detect any suspicious behavior.

That includes not spamming the APIs, sending along a useful `User-Agent` header and reporting any potential security concerns directly to Nadeo/Ubisoft.

---

Additionally, [the OAuth documentation](/oauth) contains extensive information about how to integrate external applications with the official TM OAuth API.

---

This is a community project that's actively being worked on - as such, the documentation is not complete in some areas.

Don't hesitate to reach out or get involved if you notice any inaccuracies!
