This is the (unofficial) documentation for the Trackmania (2020) game APIs, documented by the Openplanet community. It was made to be a central place for the most up-to-date documentation for the most used APIs in the game.

If you're not familiar with the authentication flow for any of the game APIs, check out [the Authentication guide](/auth).

The documentation is structured by the five main API domains, each of which cover a slightly different area of the game.

---

All game APIs are to be used responsibly. Nadeo/Ubisoft **can and will ban your accounts/IPs** if they detect any disruptive (sending too many requests too fast) or any other malicious behavior.

Make sure you send along a useful `User-Agent` header that includes what your project is, who you are (your name or some username/handle), and how to contact you (your email address). For example:

```plain
My awesome leaderboard / @Miss#8888 / miss@example.com
```

To report a potential security concern directly to Nadeo/Ubisoft, send an email to <contact@nadeo.com>.

---

Additionally, [the OAuth documentation](/oauth/summary) contains extensive information about how to integrate external applications with the official TM OAuth API.

This is a community project that's actively being worked on - as such, the documentation is not complete in some areas. Don't hesitate to reach out or get involved if you notice any inaccuracies!
